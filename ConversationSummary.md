# Tesselate Project Progress Summary

## Initial Transformation (Previous Session)
We transformed a slow, buggy Three.js tessellation application into a fast, direct WebGL implementation:

### Problem Identified
- Original app was slow due to unnecessary THREE.js overhead
- Creating adjacent triangles wasn't working properly
- Visualization didn't match the underlying triangle data

### Implementation Changes
- Replaced Three.js with direct WebGL implementation using custom shaders
- Changed from instanced rendering to a direct triangle rendering approach
- Fixed the algorithm for creating adjacent triangles that share vertices
- Added a data-changed flag to optimize buffer updates

### Key Files Modified
- js/app.js: Complete rewrite using WebGL shaders instead of THREE.js
- styles.css: Updated UI styling for a cleaner, Apple-inspired aesthetic
- index.html: Simplified to remove THREE.js dependencies

## Current Session Improvements

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Improved arrowkey functionality to create and navigate triangles intuitively
  - Fixed cmd+arrowkey to create triangles in the expected directions
  - Made selection automatically move to newly created triangles
  - Implemented a geometric approach for mapping arrow directions to triangle edges

### Visualization Options
- Added color toggle feature ('c' key) to switch between:
  - Colored mode: Displays filled triangles with subtle borders
  - Wireframe mode: Shows only triangle outlines for a cleaner view
- Implemented a special outline rendering technique using scaled triangles
- Fixed visualization issues to ensure consistent display across all triangles

### Technical Improvements
- Rewrote WebGL shader code to be more efficient and handle both rendering modes
- Created a robust approach for drawing visible outlines in wireframe mode
- Optimized buffer management for better performance
- Fixed edge cases in triangle selection and navigation

## Next Steps
- Test with higher triangle counts to verify performance
- Consider adding more geometric patterns beyond adjacent/inner/outer triangles
- Add content embedding in triangles (the original goal of the application)
- Add persistence for saving and loading triangle patterns
- Implement touch support for mobile devices
